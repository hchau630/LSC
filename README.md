  title={Disentangling images with Lie group transformations and sparse coding},
  author={Chau, Ho Yin and Qiu, Frank and Chen, Yubei and Olshausen, Bruno},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.12071},
  year={2020}
}
```
To try the code, open lsc.ipynb and run the cells.

Requires pytorch, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. By default, uses GPU.

We thank Taco Cohen for providing the code for the paper: "Learning the Irreducible Representations of Commutative Lie Groups" and the code helped us a lot during this project. If you find this code useful, please also consider to cite the following work:
